# custom-angular-2-seed-for-visual-studio-code
This is a custom angular 2 seed specifically with visual studio code configurations and settings. It started from a personal toy project I am working on in a different repository. I stripped out the code from the other project to make this a generic seed project of which other angular 2 projects can be born.

To Run:
1) npm install 
2) npm run tsc:watch:non-app
3) npm run start:webpack:dev-server
4) browse to http://localhost:8080

Warning: 
- It is possible there will be package version issues detected during step 3 b/c some packages are not pinned to any specific version. Resolve package version as necessary. I do not want to pin the version in order to get and detect updated packages per new project created from this seed.
