# custom-angular-2-seed-for-visual-studio-code
This is a custom angular 2 seed specifically with visual studio code configurations and settings. It started from a personal toy project I am working on in a different repository. I stripped out the code from the other project to make this a generic seed project of which other angular 2 projects can be born.
